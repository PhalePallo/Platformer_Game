# Platformer Game ðŸš€

A fun and interactive 2D platformer game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The player navigates through platforms, collects checkpoints, avoids enemies, and completes levels. This project demonstrates game development concepts in the browser using the Canvas API.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. Press the **Start Game** button to begin.
2. Use **Arrow Keys** or **Spacebar** to move:
   - `Arrow Right` â†’ Move right
   - `Arrow Left` â†’ Move left
   - `Arrow Up` / `Spacebar` â†’ Jump
3. Reach checkpoints to score points.
4. Avoid enemiesâ€”colliding with them will reset your position.
5. Complete all checkpoints to finish the level.
6. Multiple stages with increasing difficulty and moving hazards are included.
7. Enjoy a visually engaging game with parallax scrolling and colorful elements.

## ðŸ›  Features & Improvements

- **Player Character:** Bright orange block for visibility.
- **Platforms:** Dark green platforms with collision detection.
- **Checkpoints:** Yellow blocks that disappear when claimed.
- **Enemies:** Moving red blocks as hazards.
- **Score System:** Points awarded for reaching checkpoints.
- **Multiple Stages:** Different levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Parallax Background:** Sky and hills for depth perception.
- **Responsive Design:** Game adjusts to the window size.
- **Game-friendly Colors:** High-contrast colors for better visibility.

## ðŸ’» Concepts Learned

- **Canvas API:** Drawing and animating 2D graphics in the browser.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes for `Player`, `Platform`, `CheckPoint`, `Enemy`.
- **Collision Detection:** Platforms, checkpoints, and enemies.
- **Game Physics:** Gravity, jumping mechanics, and horizontal movement.
- **Animation Loop:** `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth gameplay.
- **Event Handling:** Keydown and keyup events for player movement.
- **Dynamic Arrays:** Mapping positions to platforms, checkpoints, and enemies.
- **UI Overlay:** Displaying checkpoint messages and score.

## âš¡ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€“ Structure and elements.
- **CSS3** â€“ Styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript** â€“ Game logic, physics, and animations.
- **Canvas API** â€“ Rendering game elements.

## ðŸ“Œ How Code Works

1. **Initialization:** Canvas, player, platforms, checkpoints, and enemies are created.
2. **Game Loop:** `animate()` updates game state, moves platforms/enemies, and checks collisions.
3. **Collision Detection:** Determines interactions with platforms, checkpoints, and enemies.
4. **Checkpoint Handling:** Player claims checkpoints and gets feedback via the overlay.
5. **Enemies Movement:** Enemies move automatically and bounce within boundaries.
6. **Player Movement:** Handled via event listeners and velocity changes.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Add **power-ups** (speed boost, invincibility).
- Add **sound effects** and **background music**.
- Implement **high-score system** with localStorage.
- Add more **levels and difficulty scaling**.
- Mobile-friendly **touch controls**.
